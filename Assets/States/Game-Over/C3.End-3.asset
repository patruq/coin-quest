  storyText: 'You begin to move into a defensive position. the Centipede makes it
    way towards you, its tiny black eye staring at you. It is about to strike.....

    And
    WHAM!!!

    You partner, Randa, lifts up the broom she has crashed down on your
    foe. She looks at you, and tosses down a small blue purse filled with quarters.
